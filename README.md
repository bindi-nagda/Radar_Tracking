# Radar_Tracking
The geographic location of a radar tracking site on the surface of the earth is known.  Its geodetic latitude, longitude, and altitude above mean sea level are specified.  Observations of a satellite are made by a radar at this site at a specified date and universal time.  The radar determines rho, elevation, azimuth  from its tracking and Doppler capability.  Write a computer code to compute the geocentric-equatorial components of position and velocity of the radar site (rs and vs) and of the satellite (r and v).  Data is from The Astronomical Almanac for the Year 2018.
